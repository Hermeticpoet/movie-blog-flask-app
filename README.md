# Python Flask Movie Blog App

This was a follow along python flask app. I built it as a test for creating my own version for a Code Institute project. The tutorials used to create this app were created by Michael Schafer and posted on You Tube.

Thank you to Michael for those tutorials and assisting me in understanding how to create such an app.
